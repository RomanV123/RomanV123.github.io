            <h2>Welcome</h2>
            <p>Welcome to the Community Cybersecurity Empowerment Initiative, an effort to protect underserved and vulnerable populations from the growing threat of cybersecurity attacks. We are dedicated to providing essential education, resources, and support to safeguard our communities against cyber threats such as phishing, ransomware, and identity theft.</p>

            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <h3>A Growing Cybersecurity Crisis Affecting Vulnerable Populations</h3>
            <p>Cybersecurity threats have escalated dramatically, affecting individuals, businesses, and governments worldwide. Phishing, ransomware, and identity theft are among the most damaging cyber attacks, compromising personal and financial information. Vulnerable communities are disproportionately affected due to limited access to cybersecurity education and resources, exacerbating social inequalities.</p>
            <h3>Evidence of Impact</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Phishing Attacks:</strong> In 2020, over 241,000 phishing sites were detected, and phishing was involved in 36% of data breaches. Vulnerable populations, such as the elderly and low-income individuals, are particularly susceptible due to a lack of awareness and education.</li>
                <li><strong>Ransomware Attacks:</strong> Ransomware incidents rose by 225% from 2018 to 2020, with hospitals, schools, and small businesses being targeted. Victims faced not only ransom costs but also expenses related to recovery and downtime.</li>
                <li><strong>Identity Theft:</strong> The FTC received 1.4 million reports of identity theft in 2020, leading to over $3.3 billion in financial losses. Children, the elderly, and low-income individuals are particularly at risk, as they may lack the resources to recover from financial losses.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Implications for Underserved Communities</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Digital Divide:</strong> Lack of cybersecurity awareness widens the digital divide, limiting opportunities for education, employment, and social engagement.</li>
                <li><strong>Economic Impact:</strong> Financial losses from cyber attacks can be devastating for individuals already facing economic hardships.</li>
            </ul>
